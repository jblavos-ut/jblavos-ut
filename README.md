#### 2024
### VISION
We reimagine the market for experience research. 
#### VALUES
Prioritize the Customer
Move Fast, 
Be Bold
Own It
Keep Growing
Be Amazing to Work With


Innovation through Research Engineering
We reinvent experience research through autonomous insights throughout the whole experience research life cycle, with automation at every step. In 2024, we will focus mainly on Insight Hub to differentiate it from research repositories.
We continue our technology-driven innovation, continuously looking for new opportunities to deliver value to our customers. This includes AI/ML-driven features but is now limited to it.
We document, implement, and uphold principles for ML features such as feedback loops, maintaining a connection to the source, and allowing a selection of what goes into an ML algorithm.
To foster widespread innovation across Engineering, PANDE, and the company, we create a virtual innovation lab, run hackathons, and organize demo fests where people come together to create new opportunities.
Domain knowledge, use of AI, and other tech.
Obstacles:  Resource constraints, conflicting priorities with other development
Measures:
Measure 1
Culture, communication, decision making
We evolve our culture to boost productivity and morale. Empowerment and a sense of urgency drive distributed decision-making, which causes a healthy culture of collaboration across the organization, independent of the organizational structure. We optimize in-person meetings,  e hold the right ones for the right reasons, and we maximize the value of those. We get better at communicating decisions, especially from in-person meetings.
The Architecture Council becomes effective and it pulls the right people together to make the right decisions. We create a redundancy in skills so we always have several people knowledgeable about an area. This allows for more job rotation and flexibility in what we work on.
All employees have solid product knowledge. We all use the product regularly (even if not in production) and are able to demo all aspects of the product end-to-end.
We encourage everyone to build on historic strengths, as opposed to going back to the past. We increasingly represent UserTesting Engineering in the larger  tech community through presentations, papers, open source submissions, and other means.
Obstacles:  History, specialization
Measures:
Measure 1
Measure 2


Developer Experience (Productivity, AI tools) 
Copilot and various niche tools are game changers and will redefine all aspects of software engineering with coding skills becoming obsolete in favor of customer interaction, business understanding, and how to turn that into specifications. We are at the forefront of this transformation, which benefits every employee as well as the company. We can use productivity gains to shorten cycles and increase throughput (as opposed to reducing costs).
We also evolve all other aspects of the product development cycle, such as our stack setup for development, verification, and staging. We can easily create staging environments that mirror production when needed.

Obstacles:  Inertia in how we work, incrementalism, perhaps even fear

Measures:


New and modern developer setup in place, less local and more in the cloud
Systematic test data generation in place (Q1’24)



Infrastructure and platform improvements
Consistency across all areas of the platform and product
Continue on path towards homogenous new environment
Clean up of old/unused infrastructure
We need to reduce our attack surface (and associated costs!) by making sure any unused resources are decommissioned. This includes infrastructure, domains, etc
Migration of existing UT Classic infrastructure to the new AWS account
Fastly - make sure we monitor all traffic and prevent any WAF workarounds due to lack of consistency in deployments (UT Classic vs UT)
ZScaler: finalise the cleanup that was initiated last year
Eliminate legacy UT environment
Regionalization
User management split customers/panel
Develop infrastructure vision and plan for the next few years
Bring on the right vendors
AWS cost reduction
SLAs and uptime
More libraries for consistency
Configuration management, hook into CCRs

Obstacles: Resource constraints 

Measures:
Legacy UserTesting AWS account decommissioned
AWS costs as % of revenue decrased by X %age points
SLAs and uptime goals defined in H1’24
SLAs and uptime goals achieved in H2’24

Description of the method
Obstacles:  What constraints will impede progress or force solutions
