# Jerrod Blavos 2024 V2MOM

## VISION
We reimagine the market for experience research.

## VALUES

>  Prioritize the Customer

>  Move Fast, Be Bold

> Own It

> Keep Growing

> Be Amazing to Work With

# 1.  
Innovation is not predictable; Risk is a requirement. Our customers can tell us what they want and need, but those wants and needs are mostly based on existing processes, systems, and paradigms.

---


We reinvent experience research through autonomous insights throughout the whole experience research life cycle, with automation at every step. In 2024, we will focus mainly on Insight Hub to differentiate it from research repositories.
We continue our technology-driven innovation, continuously looking for new opportunities to deliver value to our customers. This includes AI/ML-driven features but is now limited to it.

We document, implement, and uphold principles for ML features such as feedback loops, maintaining a connection to the source, and allowing a selection of what goes into an ML algorithm.

To foster widespread innovation across Engineering, PANDE, and the company, we create a virtual innovation lab, run hackathons, and organize demo fests where people come together to create new opportunities.
Domain knowledge, use of AI, and other tech.

# 2. Enablement Something - Developer Experience (Productivity, AI tools)
Copilot and various niche tools are game changers and will redefine all aspects of software engineering with coding skills becoming obsolete in favor of customer interaction, business understanding, and how to turn that into specifications. We are at the forefront of this transformation, which benefits every employee as well as the company. We can use productivity gains to shorten cycles and increase throughput (as opposed to reducing costs).

We also evolve all other aspects of the product development cycle, such as our stack setup for development, verification, and staging. We can easily create staging environments that mirror production when needed.

- Consistency across all areas of the platform and product
- Continue on path towards homogenous new environment
- Clean up of old/unused infrastructure
- We need to reduce our attack surface (and associated costs!) by making sure any unused resources are decommissioned. This includes infrastructure, domains, etc
- Migration of existing UT Classic infrastructure to the new AWS account
- Fastly make sure we monitor all traffic and prevent any WAF workarounds due to lack of consistency in deployments (UT Classic vs UT)
- ZScaler: finalise the cleanup that was initiated last year
- Eliminate legacy UT environment
- Regionalization
- User management split customers/panel
- Develop infrastructure vision and plan for the next few years
- Bring on the right vendors
- AWS cost reduction
- SLAs and uptime
- More libraries for consistency
- Configuration management, hook into CCRs

- DELETE UNUSED THINGSQ

## Obstacles
Inertia in how we work, incrementalism, perhaps even fear

## Measures:
- New and modern developer setup in place, less local and more in the cloud
- Systematic test data generation in place (Q1’24)
