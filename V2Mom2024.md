## VISION
To lead a highly efficient and innovative engineering team that delivers exceptional products tailored to the needs of our existing UX research customers.

To pioneer the role of research engineering methodologies, tools, and practices across PANDE in order to unlock new revenue opportunities by solving problems for a broader customer base beyond traditional user research domains.

## VALUES

- **Customer-Centricity:** Prioritize understanding and addressing the needs of our current and future customers.

- **Innovation:** Foster a culture of innovation, experimentation, and continuous improvement.

- **Empowerment:** Empower our team members to take ownership, make decisions, and drive positive change.

- **Collaboration:** Encourage cross-functional teamwork and knowledge sharing to drive holistic solutions.

- **Adaptibility:** Embrace change and proactively respond to evolving market trends and customer demands.

## METHODS
### 1. Invest in THE NOW: Drive efficiency in Product Engineering through enablement
Depending on the implementation, engineering tools, processes, and policies used to deliver updates to our product can hinder or accelerate the delivery of high-quality products for our core customer.

Therefore as we change or introduce tools, policies, and processes we must be viligant to avoid unnecessarily saddling our teams with delays, bottlenecks, [and other types of "waste"](https://medium.com/@markbarbs/the-7-wastes-of-lean-software-development-1a6acbe9d5d7).

AI-enabled tools such as Copilot, ChatGPT, Bard, are redefining the role of software engineering with mundane tasks being made less budrdensome, allowing for more focus on customer interaction, business understanding, and how to turn that into functioning, useful, usable, valuable, and delightful products. We have the opportunity during this somewhat chaotic time to replace old ways of doing and thinking with tooling that will shorten cycles and increase throughput (as opposed to reducing costs).

Investment in the foundations of the UT platform developer experience made in previous years were leveraged to accellerate our path to releasing Surveys, which is the most substantial expansion of the core UT platform since the introduction of moderated testing with Live conversations back in 2018.

A transformational change to Quality Engineering in 2023 created a high-performing and highly effective team purpose built to exploit cutting edge tools coming to market. We will drive consistently higher quality throughout the product by embedding quality practices earlier into PANDE development cycles.  We will build on the momentum generated with performance testing started for our production migration and establish it as a common and expected practice for teams.

#### Obstacles
- Inconsistency in tools, processes and practices across teams
- Entrenchment in work is done and delivered; resistance to change

#### Measures
- Product Delivery timelines are consistently met by teams
- All PANDE teams operate on a consistent CI/CD flow and deliver to customers daily, removing batched releases, large regression testing cycles, and manual release processes
- Define and expand usage of SPACE and DORA metrics with baselines, goals, consistent tracking, and accountibility.
- Deliver a useful internal Dev Experience Portal to aggregate and disseminate internal service knowledge and tooling for our engineers ( such as https://backstage.io/ )
- Continue to stay current on all critical dependencies (libraries, frameworks, and languages), proactively evaluating and adopting new versions.
- Identify opportunities and implement at least one new set of libraries for consistency (UT Events for example)
- We shut down unnecessary services and code (Uploader, Video Processor)
- Implement and make available Cloud-Based modern developer environments with Github Codespaces
- Systematic test data generation in place

### 2. Invest in THE FUTURE: Discover and define the role of UT in an increasingly AI-enabled world:

In order to reinvent experience research and expand our customer base we introduce research engineering methodologies, tools, and practices into our teams, enabling the expansion of product use cases beyond traditional user research domains.

This could take the form of innovation days, weeks, labs or ad-hoc/virtual teams to explore and exploit emerging  and maturing technology such as generative AI, modern tools, and partnership and market opportunities that extend the capabilities and use-cases of our products.

## Obstacles
- Deeply ingrained focus on UX research persona requests
- Ambivalence and/or fear of projects which explore emerging tech and partnership oppotunities
- Pockets of belief that any exploration which intersects with a customer use-case must be driven by, thorugh, and out of product management and must adhere to the PDLC
