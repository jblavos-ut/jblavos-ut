## VISION
To lead a highly efficient and innovative engineering team that delivers exceptional products tailored to the needs of our existing UX research customers.

To pioneer the role of research engineering methodologies, tools, and practices across PANDE in order to unlock new revenue opportunities by solving problems for a broader customer base beyond traditional user research domains.

## VALUES

- **Customer-Centricity:** Prioritize understanding and addressing the needs of our current and future customers.

- **Innovation:** Foster a culture of innovation, experimentation, and continuous improvement.

- **Empowerment:** Empower our team members to take ownership, make decisions, and drive positive change.

- **Collaboration:** Encourage cross-functional teamwork and knowledge sharing to drive holistic solutions.

- **Adaptibility:** Embrace change and proactively respond to evolving market trends and customer demands.

## METHODS
### 1. NOW: Drive efficiency in Product Engineering through enablement
Engineering processes and workflows required to deliver updates to our product can hinder or accelerate the delivery of high-quality products for existing UX research customers, focusing on usability, reliability, and performance.

We understand the Where we introduce new policies and processes we must be viligant to avoid unnecessarily introducing delays and bottlenecks for delivery.

Copilot and various niche tools are game changers and will redefine all aspects of software engineering with coding skills becoming obsolete in favor of customer interaction, business understanding, and how to turn that into specifications. We are at the forefront of this transformation, which benefits every employee as well as the company. We can use productivity gains to shorten cycles and increase throughput (as opposed to reducing costs).

We evolve all other aspects of the product development cycle, such as our stack setup for development, verification, and staging. We can easily create staging environments that mirror production when needed.

#### Obstacles
- Inconsistency across areas of the platform and product
- Inconsistent team practices & culture
- Inertia in how we work, incrementalism, perhaps even fear


#### Measures
- Product Delivery timelines are met by all teams
- All teams operate on CI/CD and deliver to customers daily, removing manual and batched releases
- Define and expand usage of SPACE and DORA metrics
- Deliver a useful internal Dev Experience Portal to aggregate and disseminate internal service knowledge and tooling for our engineers ( such as https://backstage.io/ ) by EOY-23
- Continue to stay current on all critical dependencies (libraries, frameworks, and languages), proactively evaluating and adopting new versions.
- Identify opportunities and implement at least one new set of libraries for consistency (UT Events for example)
- We shut down unnecessary services and code (Uploader, Video Processor)
- Implement and make available Cloud-Based modern developer environments with Github Codespaces
- New and modern developer setup in place, less local and more in the cloud
- Systematic test data generation in place (Q1’24)

### 2. THE FUTURE: Establish Research Engineering:
In order to reinvent experience research and expand our customer base we introduce research engineering methodologies, tools, and practices into our teams, enabling the expansion of product use cases beyond traditional user research domains.

This could take the form of innovation days, weeks, labs or ad-hoc/virtual teams to explore and exploit emerging  and maturing technology such as generative AI, modern tools, and partnership and market opportunities that extend the capabilities and use-cases of our products.

## Obstacles
- Deeply ingrained focus on UX research persona requests
- Ambivalence and/or fear of projects which explore emerging tech and partnership oppotunities
- Pockets of belief that any exploration which intersects with a customer use-case must be driven by, thorugh, and out of product management and must adhere to the PDLC

## Measures:
-

### 3. Educational Initiatives:
Offer training programs, workshops, and resources to upskill engineering teams in research engineering methodologies and tools, empowering them to drive innovation and create value for customers.
