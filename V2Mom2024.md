## VISION
To lead a highly efficient and innovative engineering team that delivers exceptional products tailored to the needs of our existing UX research customers.


To pioneer the role of research engineering methodologies, tools, and practices across PANDE in order to unlock new revenue streams by solving problems for a broader customer base beyond traditional user research domains.

## VALUES

- **Customer-Centricity:** Prioritize understanding and addressing the needs of our current and future customers.

- **Innovation:** Foster a culture of innovation, experimentation, and continuous improvement.

- **Empowerment:** Empower our team members to take ownership, make decisions, and drive positive change.

- **Collaboration:** Encourage cross-functional teamwork and knowledge sharing to drive holistic solutions.

- **Adaptibility:** Embrace change and proactively respond to evolving market trends and customer demands.

## METHODS
### 1. Streamline Product Engineering
Engineering processes and workflows required to deliver updates to our product accelerate the delivery of high-quality products for existing UX research customers, focusing on usability, reliability, and performance.

Copilot and various niche tools are game changers and will redefine all aspects of software engineering with coding skills becoming obsolete in favor of customer interaction, business understanding, and how to turn that into specifications. We are at the forefront of this transformation, which benefits every employee as well as the company. We can use productivity gains to shorten cycles and increase throughput (as opposed to reducing costs).

We also evolve all other aspects of the product development cycle, such as our stack setup for development, verification, and staging. We can easily create staging environments that mirror production when needed.

#### Obstacles
- [TK] Consistency across all areas of the platform and product
- [TK] Continue on path towards homogenous new environment
- [TK] Clean up of old/unused infrastructure
- [TK] We need to reduce our attack surface (and associated costs!) by making sure any unused resources are decommissioned. This includes infrastructure, domains, etc
- [TK] Migration of existing UT Classic infrastructure to the new AWS account
- [TK] Fastly make sure we monitor all traffic and prevent any WAF workarounds due to lack of consistency in deployments (UT Classic vs UT)
- [TK] ZScaler: finalise the cleanup that was initiated last year
- [TK] Eliminate legacy UT environment
- [TK] Regionalization
- [TK] User management split customers/panel
- [TK] Develop infrastructure vision and plan for the next few years
- [TK] Bring on the right vendors
- [TK] AWS cost reduction
- [TK] SLAs and uptime
- [TK] More libraries for consistency
- [TK] Configuration management, hook into CCRs

#### Measures
- [TK] New and modern developer setup in place, less local and more in the cloud
- [TK] Systematic test data generation in place (Q1’24)
- [TK Space metrics]

### 2. Establish Research Engineering:
Integrate "research engineering" methodologies, tools, and practices into our teams, enabling the expansion of product use cases beyond traditional user research domains.

Create dedicated innovation labs or teams within engineering to explore and prototype new features, technologies, and solutions that extend the capabilities of our products and address emerging market and technological trends.

---

We reinvent experience research through autonomous insights throughout the whole experience research life cycle, with automation at every step. In 2024, we will focus mainly on Insight Hub to differentiate it from research repositories.

We continue our technology-driven innovation, continuously looking for new opportunities to deliver value to our customers. This includes AI/ML-driven features but is now limited to it.

We document, implement, and uphold principles for ML features such as feedback loops, maintaining a connection to the source, and allowing a selection of what goes into an ML algorithm.

To foster widespread innovation across Engineering, PANDE, and the company, we create a virtual innovation lab, run hackathons, and organize demo fests where people come together to create new opportunities.

Domain knowledge, use of AI, and other tech.

# 2. Enablement Something - Developer Experience (Productivity, AI tools)
Copilot and various niche tools are game changers and will redefine all aspects of software engineering with coding skills becoming obsolete in favor of customer interaction, business understanding, and how to turn that into specifications.
